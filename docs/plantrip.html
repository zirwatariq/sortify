                    If you are coming to the United States from another country or another state, you will likely 
                    travel through many places, either with friends or on your own. The best advice I've received 
                    thus far is to schedule your travel in advance because last-minute flights and bus and rail 
                    tickets are almost always far more expensive. However, you must first travel to Syracuse,
                    either to reach the airport or the Regional Transportation Center, where you can access trains and 
                    buses.
                    You can book a bus ticket either through <a href="https://www.greyhound.com/AC" class="links"> Greyhound, </a>                                      
                    <a href="https://www.flixbus.com/" class="links"> Flixbus,</a> or explore more through <a href="https://www.busbud.com/en" class="links">BusBud.</a><br>
                    The only rail option you have is <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/home.html" class="links">Amtrak.</a>

                <h2>Explore City</h2>
                <p class="secondcontent">If you are planning to explore the city of Oswego, the best option you have is either to take a bus because 
                    that would be cheap. Other than that, you can also rent an <a href="bird-e-scooters-1(oswegony.org)" class="links">electric scooter</a> for a short period of time.  
                    Students at <abbr title="State University Of NewYork">SUNY</abbr> receive free bus service within the city.</p>
                   <p> On campus, you can also borrow a <a href="https://lakerlife.oswego.edu/organization/bikeshare" class="links">free bike</a> at any time 
                    of the year. If you intend to spend the summer on campus, I would advise you to submit an bike application long in 
                    advance though. </p>
