              <p class="newcontent1">
                When you move to a new nation, or even to a different region 
                of the same country, I think food is a significant issue. Additionally, 
                it takes more time to adjust to American flavors when you are coming from 
                a nation where food is renowned for its rich flavor and variety of spices.
                Oswego is not a large city, so there may not be many grocery store choices,
                but there are still several, like Walmart, Price Chopper, Aldi, and others.</p>
              </div>

                <h2>Halal Meat</h2>
                <p class="newcontent1">You may not be able to discover any stores that sell halal meat in Oswego.
                For that, you need to go to Syracuse, where you can find halal meat and most 
                of the spices of Asia and elsewhere.</p>

            <h2>Kosher Meat</h2>
            <p class="newcontent1">
                Although there are some stores in Oswego that sell Kosher meat .But we also recommend to make sure before buying. </p>

                <h2>Fresh Vegetables</h2> 
                <p class="newcontent1">Various superstores in Oswego provide both fresh and canned versions of fruits and vegetables.
                If you are looking for fresh vegetables or fresh-baked products, don’t miss the Oswego Farmer’s Market takes 
                place Thursday evenings from 4:30pm to 8:30pm on West First Street between Bridge 
                and Oneida Streets. The Market runs from the end of May through October and allows 
                you to buy produce from local farms.

<h3>Registered Dietitian on Campus:</h3>
<p class="newcontent1">
  You can also consult with the <a href="https://www.oswego.edu/auxiliary-services/nutrition-information-and-services" class="links" > Registered Dietitian</a> on campus and ask for a diet plan. Other than that,
    if you’re paying for a meal plan on campus, you can enjoy gluten-free and vegan options, but you must
    sometimes ask the servers whether the food suits your needs.</p>
