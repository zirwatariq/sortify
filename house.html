        <h1><span class="first">About</span> <br>Living in Oswego</h1>
      <p>If you’re coming to Oswego from a different country or even from a different state of the <abbr title="United States">US.</abbr> 
          you need to explore your options. If you don’t have your house in Oswego, you have two options: 
          either live on campus or off campus. Before making that decision, consider the pros and cons of 
          both options available.</p> 

       </div>
    </div>
    <p class="newcontent">
        According to the college website:
        <span class="highlight"> undergraduate degree student </span> are required to live on campus at <abbr title="State University Of NewYork">SUNY</abbr> Oswego 
        unless they are 21 years-of-age. ALL <span class="highlight">Exchange Students</span> are required to live on 
        campus for at least one full semester.<span class="highlight">Graduate Students</span> are not required to live 
        on campus but are welcome to do so.
    </p> 
    <div class="additionalcontent">
       <h2>Living On Campus</h2> 
        <p class="oncampus">
            If you are an undergraduate student at <abbr title="State University Of NewYork">SUNY</abbr> Oswego and are not residing in an off-campus residence, you must stay on campus.
            Some students choose to live on campus while they are enrolled in classes in order to take advantage of the unique possibilities 
            that come with doing so.Living on a college campus is enjoyable. You get the opportunity to converse with more individuals and to 
            discover other cultures. Along with that, you also have the opportunity to take part in events and games that are exclusively held 
            in residence halls.You can also minimize your living expenses by becoming <span style="font-weight: 600;"> Resident Advisor </span>(RA) or <span style="font-weight: 600;">Desk Attendant</span> (DA) of those halls. 
            Above all, you can be a part of the Laker Leader program, for which you will welcome incoming students and receive benefits.
            If you want to live in one of the <a href="https://www.oswego.edu/residence-life-and-housing/home" class="links" >resident halls</a> or prefer an apartment on campus, <a href="https://ww1.oswego.edu/student-life/living-oswego/residence-communities/village-townhouses" class="links" >The Village</a>
            is a perfect option for you. Students will enjoy a more independent experience in The Village. It is like 
            having an off-campus apartment while living on campus.</p>
            
          <h2>Living Off Campus</h2>

          <p class="oncampus">
            Finding a home off campus, especially if you're unfamiliar with the area, may be quite difficult. You will probably wish to locate a cheap apartment close to the college 
            so there won't be any difficulty getting to campus at any moment.The facilities included in the rent are another important factor in your decision. The majority of rental 
            homes include furnishings for the bedrooms and living rooms. Some apartment rents cover utilities and insurance for the duration of the lease, while others do not. In order 
            to avoid confusion, read the lease carefully before signing it. While living off-campus, there are numerous employment you can obtain. Graduate students can also work as graduate assistants on campus</p>
            <p class="oncampus1"> <a href="https://www.lakesideoswego.com/" class="links">Lakeside Commons</a> also offers student only apartments near <abbr title="State University Of NewYork">SUNY</abbr> Oswego
           or you can also explore <span style="font-weight: 600;">Zillow</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600;">Facebook Market</span> for off campus accommodation.</p>

        <h3>Rental Insurance</h3>
        <p class="oncampus-1">
            The other factor you should take into account while looking for a rental home is rental insurance. This will protect you in case of any loss or damage. It's good if the rental 
            fee covers the cost of insurance, but you may need to find a provider of rental insurance. I advise you to investigate <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/?f=1" class="links">lemonade</a> or other companies and request a quote based on 
            your requirements.</p>
